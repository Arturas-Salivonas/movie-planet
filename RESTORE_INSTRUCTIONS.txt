IMPORTANT: The progressive loading code in Map.tsx was accidentally lost.

The working version should have:
1. loadedImagesRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set())
2. Progressive loading in batches (BATCH_SIZE = 20)
3. needsLoading check to prevent unnecessary loading screens
4. Proper loading state management

Please check CACHE_FIXES.md and LOADING_FIX.md for implementation details.

The user reported: "📊 Loaded 571 movies for progressive rendering" in console,
so this feature was working before.

I apologize for the mistake. The correct implementation needs to be restored.
